This design means a lot to me. It has been on my mind to share the design again because a friend of mine just recently flew to Calgary to visit her birth father and his family for the first time ever. They connected through DNA test results. Highs and lows always swirl about as we venture into uncharted territory, but what a territory to explore - if it is found to be safe one.

I tried to put myself into her shoes and what that would even feel like to meet her birth father. I couldn't do it. I couldn't even imagine what would come over me. I think it is one of those experiences that is so rare that you only know how you will be, once you have experienced it.
