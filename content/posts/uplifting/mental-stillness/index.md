Took time for this just this morning. It is so good in a busy world, and a world full of plans.

Take the time. What do you do in order to find mental stillness? I take time before everyone gets up in the morning to have some quiet time to read my Bible, to sit in stillness after, and then to pray. Honestly, the hardest part is to sit in the stillness. Can you sit in the stillness for 3 minutes? Give it a try.
