Here is a list of 6 fun hiking adventures in beautiful #Nanaimo on #VancouverIsland ☀️

I am such an ocean girl, I just want to see it, breathe it, be on it, feel it. I love living on an island, and this island has waterfalls? lakes? rivers? INCREDIBLE. I just love our island.

What is your fav spot on our island of beauty?
