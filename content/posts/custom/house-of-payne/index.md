"This image represents my journey of self-love. Realizing that both my light and my dark side make me who I am. They both give me strength and are essential for personal growth and self-acceptance.

<!--more-->
The light side symbolizes positivity, compassion, joy, laughter, fun, and empathy. Light that inspires (self and those around you). The dark side encompasses the complexities of our fears, vulnerabilities, and imperfections, managing depression and crippling anxiety. Yet, these often hold valuable lessons of strength, grit, and resilience. 

By understanding and embracing both aspects, you can be the most authentic version of yourself. You can create an emotional strength that allows you to look at yourself with confidence and grace."
~ Trainer Tanna Payne
